Just some complaints -- Is there anyone that is trying to make a real game now? I am sick of shits that only want you to spend money on it or force you to watch ADs.
I miss the day when games are arts instead of tools for businessmen to squeeze even more money from stupid people who works for them. The tool that fools people
, indulge them into a fake dream of living an acceptable life. I mean, it's true. Games are like novels, drugs or some other shit that gives peple an exit to run away
from real life, which is usually ..shitty. But in the old days, at least they were fun! Look at those shit you can find in google play, app store. Most of them just
makes you to do more jubs, more works, inorder to not doing those jobs, you need to spend money! What is this? What is this? Is this a game? Would you call it a game?

Don't get me wrong. There are people making real games. I know. I love them. It's just. How can Real games lose to those shits? I am so confused. How is there more shitty
games in the market than real games? How do shitty games earn more money than real games? Is there something wrong with the system? Or it's just people don't deserve
real games?
